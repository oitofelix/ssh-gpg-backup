Usage: $0 [USER@]HOST

Restore backup made by ssh-gpg-backup.

The Gzip-compressed, GPG-encrypted (Tar-archived) backup file is
expected inside the local directory HOST/, relative to the current
working directory.

GNU Tar is used on the remote host to extract the backup archive sent
over the network, and therefore must be available in its PATH.
Decryption and decompression are performed on the local side.

This program asks for the GPG passphrase before starting its actual
work." 1>&2
