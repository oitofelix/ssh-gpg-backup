ssh-gpg-backup
==============

This package is intended for creation, verification and restoration of
Tar-archived, Gzip-compressed and GPG-encrypted backups between remote
hosts through SSH.  Therefore, this is a simple and general remote
backup solution using standard GNU tools.

Three scripts are provided for creation, verification and restoration
of backup files: ssh-gpg-backup, ssh-gpg-backup-verify and
ssh-gpg-backup-restore.

The direct dependencies of this package are:

  - GNU Bash (http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/);
  - GNU Coreutils (http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/);
  - GNU Tar (http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/);
  - GNU Gzip (http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/);
  - GNU Privacy Guard (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnupg/);
  - SSH (https://www.openssh.com/).

Only a mostly POSIX-compliant Tar is needed on the remote end, though.


ssh-gpg-backup
--------------

Usage: ssh-gpg-backup SRC_USER SRC_HOST SRC_PATH BKP_USER BKP_HOST BKP_ARCHIVE

Backup SRC_PATH from SRC_HOST as SRC_USER into Tar-archived,
Gzip-compressed and GPG-encrypted BKP_ARCHIVE within BKP_HOST as
BKP_USER.

Tar is used on SRC_HOST to archive the backup before sending it
through SSH to BKP_HOST.  Compression and encryption are performed on
the local host.

Hint: SRC_HOST and/or BKP_HOST may be the same host and/or localhost.


ssh-gpg-backup-verify
---------------------

Usage: $(basename $0) BKP_USER BKP_HOST BKP_ARCHIVE

Verify integrity of Tar-archived, Gzip-compressed and GPG-encrypted
BKP_ARCHIVE within BKP_HOST as BKP_USER.

Decryption, decompression and archive verification are all performed
on the local host.

Hint: BKP_HOST may be localhost.


ssh-gpg-backup-restore
----------------------

Usage: ssh-gpg-backup-verify BKP_USER BKP_HOST BKP_ARCHIVE BKP_PATH RST_USER RST_HOST RST_PATH

Restore BKP_PATH residing within BKP_ARCHIVE stored in BKP_HOST as
BKP_USER to RST_PATH within RST_HOST as RST_USER.

Tar is used on RST_HOST to extract the backup archive sent to it
through SSH.  Decryption and decompression are performed on the local
host.

Hint: BKP_HOST and/or RST_HOST may be the same host and/or localhost.
