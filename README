ssh-gpg-backup
==============

This package is intended for incrementally Tar-archiving,
Gzip-compressing and GPG-encrypting entire remote root file systems
through SSH.  Therefore, this is a simple incremental remote backup
solution using standard GNU tools.

Three scripts are provided for backup, verification and restoration:
ssh-gpg-backup, ssh-gpg-backup-verify, ssh-gpg-backup-restore,
respectively.

The direct dependencies of this package are:

  - GNU Bash (https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/);
  - GNU tar (https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/);
  - GNU Gzip (http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/);
  - GnuPG (https://gnupg.org/);
  - SSH (https://www.openssh.com/).

Only GNU tar is needed on the remote end, though.
